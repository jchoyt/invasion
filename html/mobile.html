        Welcome to Invasion a futuristic, browser-based massively-multiplayer online roleplaying game. Join in the fight for power and control with characters, creatures and dark forces as you forge the future for your kind. Secure resources and territories as you hurl through space wondering if it is your mind you are hearing or something else.  Generations have lived off-world for centuries and you are not the first to inhabit this place. But now something strange and frightening is happening on these deep space stations. It all started with the voices. At first people thought they were dreams, but clear that what is happening here is real. Is it the station trying to communicate or something else? Strange, ethereal messages are being heard throughout the station and none of them are the same. People are going mad, some are mutating. Some people hear nothing and fear for their lives.  Join the fight, scramble for your sanity, delight in the rewards of being victorious. Can you make it through ... Invasion?
