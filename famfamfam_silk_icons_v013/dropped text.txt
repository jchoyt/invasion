At the heart of GitHub is an open source version control system (VCS) called Git. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer.

If you're not comfortable using the command line right now, GitHub lets you complete many Git-related actions without using the command line, including:

Creating a repository
Forking a repository
Being social
However, if you find that you need to use Git, we can help you set it up!

Tip: to learn more about Git, see "Getting Started - Git Basics" on the git-scm website.
Input
Setting up Git

Download and install the latest version of Git.
On your computer, open the Terminal application.
Tell Git your name so your commits will be properly labeled. Type everything after the $ here:

git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
Tell Git the email address that will be associated with your Git commits. The email you specify should be the same one found in your email settings. To keep your email address hidden, see "Keeping your email address private".

git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
Next steps: Authenticating with GitHub from Git

When you connect to a GitHub repository from Git, you'll need to authenticate with GitHub using either HTTPS or SSH.

Connecting over HTTPS (recommended)

If you clone with HTTPS, you can cache your GitHub password in Git using a credential helper.

Connecting over SSH

If you clone with SSH, you must generate SSH keys on each computer you use to push or pull from GitHub.

Celebrate

Congratulations, you now have Git and GitHub all set up! What do you want to do next?
